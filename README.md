RankLib
==========
Fork of RankLib that can be originally found in the pages of [Lemur] project. This fork probably won't provide any enhancements, it will just adjust some methods for more convenient work within the Java project. It means that methods can be called directly from my Java code and the results will be returned as Objects and not as a file.
